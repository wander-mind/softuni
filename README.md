# 🎓 SoftUni Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here you'll find a collection of my projects from the Software University of Sofia (SoftUni). This repository showcases my work across various courses, including C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, HTML/CSS, Quality Assurance (QA), and Agile methodologies. 🚀

## 📚 Courses and Projects

Although the courses cover a wide range of programming languages, I will focus on projects primarily in Python, JavaScript, and C++ (with some HTML/CSS), as I believe these are the essential languages to learn. Additionally, I have two workbooks in Python and C++ from my university days at the Technical University of Sofia, where I graduated as a Computer and Software Engineer.
